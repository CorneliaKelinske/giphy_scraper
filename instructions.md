Create an elixir project using `mix new` named "GiphyScraper" and write a simple project that allows you to call `GiphyScraper.search(query)` and returns 25 results in the following format:



[
  %GiphyImage{
    id: "some_id", 
    url: "url_to_gif", 
    username: "username of creator", 
    title: "SomeGif"
  },

  %GiphyImage{
    id: "some_other_id", 
    url: "url_to_gif_2", 
    username: "username of creator", 
    title: "MyGif"
  }
]
	
I recommend using the HTTPoison module to make the requests and you can find the Giphy endpoint here. 



Note: the naming of `GiphyScraper` and `GiphyImage` are up to you to determine.
